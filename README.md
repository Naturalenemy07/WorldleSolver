# WorldleSolver
[Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/) is a game where the player guesses the name of the country based on its outline. This is a wonderful game suitable for anyone interested in geography. This program is intended to solve Worldle puzzles automaticaly with no player input. 

One issue I realized during this project was I only have one image for each conuntry. I initially am using the 1024 pixel image for training. I am not optimistic in the success of my model and will potentially look at also using the other sized images from mapsicon to train my model. Will update after my initial training.

Country shape dataset is from Github user djaiss repository [mapsicon](https://github.com/djaiss/mapsicon).
